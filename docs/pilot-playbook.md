## 4) Common Objections + Suggested Responses

- “আমরা কাগজেই কাজ করি, সফটওয়্যার লাগবে না।”
- Start with only attendance + print for 2 weeks; keep paper in parallel until confidence builds.
- “স্টাফদের টেকনিক্যাল দক্ষতা কম।”
- Use 1-hour role-based training; keep only 3 daily tasks in phase 1 (attendance, notice, routine).
- “ইন্টারনেট সবসময় থাকে না।”
- Encourage end-of-day entry if live marking is not possible; print outputs still available when connected.
- “ডাটা সেফ তো?”

- “সময় বেশি লাগবে না তো?”
- Demo timing shows daily attendance can be completed in a few minutes per class.
